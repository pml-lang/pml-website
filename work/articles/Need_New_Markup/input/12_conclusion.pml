    As demonstrated in this article, a good number of problems encountered with existing document markup languages vanish with the PML syntax.
    
    Now we should come together to improve PML and make it more powerful, so that it covers more use cases and more people can benefit from it.

    Please help to spread the word. Or try out PML and send feedback, so that we know what needs to be refined. Your voice counts!

    The vision is to create the best possible document markup language and all necessary tools, so that writers can focus on writing and enjoy creating beautiful documents in a minimum of time - without worrying about unneeded complexity.
