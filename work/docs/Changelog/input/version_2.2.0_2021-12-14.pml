                Unicode escape sequences above FFFF are now supported. This is useful to insert emoticons and some Asian characters.

                The existing syntax for 4 hex digits Unicode escapes is [c \\uhhhh].

                The new (additional) syntax for 8 hex digits Unicode escapes is [c \\Uhhhhhhhh]. Note the uppercase U which is used to denote that 8 hex digits are used.

                Examples are shown in chapter [link url=https://www.pml-lang.dev/docs/user_manual/index.html#escape_characters text="Escape Characters"] of the user manual.
