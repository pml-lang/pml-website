{ch title=Introduction: What's the Problem?

    There are many document markup languages available already. Wikipedia lists over 70 variations in its {link url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_document_markup_languages text=List of document markup languages} - among them HTML, Markdown, Docbook, Asciidoctor, reStructuredText, etc.

    Why, then, does the title of this article suggest we need {i yet another one} ???

    What's the problem?

    There are two fundamental problems with the existing document markup languages: Either they are not easy to use, or they are not well suited to write complex documents, such as technical articles, user manuals, or books. An example of "not easy to use, but suited for complex documents" would be Docbook. An example of "easy to use, but not suited for complex documents" would be Markdown.

    Of course, the above categorization is simplistic. But it should serve as a good starting point to get the gist of this article which aims to delineate the kind of problems that occur in practice. You'll see many representative examples of markup code that illustrates what's wrong, complemented by links to more information.

    You'll also discover a {i new} markup language. Lots of examples will demonstrate how a new syntax can lead to a language that is "easy to use and suited for complex documents". A {i proof-of-concept} implementation is already available. More on this later.
