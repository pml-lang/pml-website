[ch (id=introduction) [title Introduction]

    This document describes advanced PML features.

    Advanced features aim to simplify and automate the writing/publishing process as far as possible. As a result they can significantly increase productivity, reliability, and maintainability, especially in professional environments where documents change often, content depends on external resources, or parts of the document must be created and updated automatically.

    For example, advanced features enable you to:
    [list
        [el embed Javascript source code in PML documents, to dynamically generate PML code and resources (e.g. graphical components like diagrams) at build-time, and to execute external OS commands and scripts that can create content or do anything else related to the PML document]
        [el create [i user-defined nodes] which you can then use in all your PML documents, in addition to the standard nodes provided by PML]
        [el convert a PML document to an XML document (or vice versa) and apply XML technologies to PML documents (e.g. validate, query, modify, or transform documents)]
        [el use a Java API to configure and execute PML commands programmatically]
    ]

    The setup/configuration of advanced features requires some technical knowledge. However, once configured by skilled people, these features are often easy to use by non-tech-savvy document creators. This potentially eliminates the need for complex tool chains that must be installed, configured, and maintained.
