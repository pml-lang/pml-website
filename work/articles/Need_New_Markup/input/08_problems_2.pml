    I this chapter we'll look at examples that reveal {i some} problems encountered with markup languages. This is by no means an exhaustive enumeration of all troubles and corner cases. The aim is to just show a few examples that demonstrate the kind of inconveniences and limits encountered in the real world.

    For each example the markup code will be shown in {link url=https://www.w3.org/TR/html/ text=HTML}, {link url=https://asciidoctor.org/ text=Asciidoctor}, {link url=http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html text=reStructuredText}, and {link url=https://www.pml-lang.dev text=PML}.

    If you want to try out some code, you can use the following online testers (no need to install anything on your PC):
    {list
        {el {link url=https://www.w3schools.com/tryit/ text=HTML}}
        {el {link url=https://asciidoclive.com text=Asciidoctor}}
        {el {link url=http://rst.ninjs.org text=reStructuredText}}
    }

    An online tester for PML is not yet available. You have to install PML on a Windows PC if you want to try it out.
