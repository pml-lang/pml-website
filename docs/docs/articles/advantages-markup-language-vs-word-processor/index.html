However, more and more people are writing their documents using another, less known option: a <i class="pml-italic">document markup language</i>.</p>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">Why?</p>

                            <h2 class="pml-chapter-title">WYSIWYG Editors</h2>
                            <p class="pml-paragraph">Offline or online WYSIWYG editors are often the best solution for non-technical people who occasionally write short or medium-size documents. Some websites have their own WYSIWYG editor integrated in the website, which makes it very easy to write formatted text. WYSIWYG software is also the right choice for design-intensive publications where you want to have total control of the position, size, font, and other visual properties of the document's elements, and you want to immediately see and trim the end result while working on the document. Examples of such documents are flyers, advertisements, party invitations, posters, etc.</p>

                                <h3 class="pml-chapter-title">Basic Concept</h3>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">A <i class="pml-italic">document markup language</i> consists of a set of rules and symbols (special characters) used to annotate plain text. The annotated text can then be read by a <i class="pml-italic">markup processor</i> to generate styled documents (e.g. HTML, PDF, ePub, etc.) or any other kind of data.</p>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">For example, in some markup languages an underline (<code class="pml-inline-code">_</code>) is used to emphasize text and render it in italics. Writing:</p>
                                <pre class="pml-code"><code class="nohighlight">A _good_ girl.</code></pre>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">... results in:<br /> A <i class="pml-italic">good</i> girl.</p>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">Hence, <i class="pml-italic">markup code</i> is just plain text intermixed with markup instructions.</p>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">A <i class="pml-italic">markup document</i> consists of one or more text files that contain markup code.</p>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_document_markup_languages" class="pml-link">many</a> document markup languages to choose from.</p>

                                <h3 class="pml-chapter-title">Simple Example</h3>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">Suppose you create a text file with the following content (written in Markdown syntax):</p>
                                <pre class="pml-code"><code class="nohighlight"># Simple Markup Example

Here is a list:

- orange
- banana
- apple</code></pre>
                                <p class="pml-paragraph">After the above text has been converted to HTML (by the markup processor), the result in the browser looks like this:</p>

                                <p class="pml-paragraph">The style of the final document can be customized. This is often done by modifying a separate CSS files.</p>

                                        <p class="pml-paragraph">When you write, you focus on content, not on presentation. You focus on what you want to say, instead of how it should be displayed or printed.</p>
                                        <p class="pml-paragraph">Moreover, you can customize your writing environment (editor) without worrying about the end result. For example, you can use a different font and a different number of characters displayed per line, without thinking about how this will affect the final document.</p>

                                        <p class="pml-paragraph">Sometimes the same stylesheet is used for many documents. Thus, presentation remains consistent over large sets of documents.

                                        <p class="pml-paragraph">Some markup languages allow you to split a document into different files.</p>
                                        <p class="pml-paragraph">For example, each chapter of a book (and maybe also each sub-chapter) can be stored in a different file and in a directory hierarchy of your choice.</p>

                                        <h5 class="pml-chapter-title">Semantic Markup</h5>
                                        <p class="pml-paragraph">Some document markup languages support only <i class="pml-italic">presentation</i> tags. The better breed of them prefer <i class="pml-italic">semantic</i> tags over <i class="pml-italic">presentation</i> tags. This means that, when you use markup, you specify the <i class="pml-italic">meaning</i> of a piece of text. You do not specify <i class="pml-italic">how</i> the text will be displayed or printed. You define the <i class="pml-italic">What</i>, not the <i class="pml-italic">How</i>.</p>
                                        <p class="pml-paragraph">A first benefit is that this leads to much more flexibility in the rendering process.</p>
                                        <p class="pml-paragraph">Suppose your text contains several warning messages that need to stand out. If you use a markup language that supports only <i class="pml-italic">presentation</i> tags, you could decide to aggressively display a centered text in red on yellow, like this:</p>
                                        <p style="color:red; background:yellow; padding:0.5em; border:1px dotted lightgrey; font-weight:bold; text-align:center;" class="pml-paragraph">Do not forget to unplug your coffee machine before opening it. </p>
                                        <p class="pml-paragraph">This works well if the warnings are displayed on a color screen. But if the document is printed on a color-less printer, or displayed on a black-and-white e-ink device, the result is a mess.</p>
                                        <p class="pml-paragraph">On the other hand, in a markup language that provides <i class="pml-italic">semantic</i> tags, you would simply adorn your warnings with a <code class="pml-inline-code">warning</code> tag. The stylesheet used in the conversion process specifies <i class="pml-italic">how</i> all warnings are displayed. Hence, you can globally change the presentation of all warnings for a given output device by simply changing <i class="pml-italic">one</i> entry in the corresponding stylesheet. For example, in the stylesheet used for e-ink devices, you could specify to display the warnings in <i class="pml-italic"><b class="pml-bold">italics with a bigger font</b></i>. Moreover, if you have other messages that have to stand out, like errors or tips, you can use different, specific tags and handle them separately, without any interference.</p>
                                        <p class="pml-paragraph">A second advantage is that semantic markup opens the door for searchable documentation databases. You can query your markup code and extract useful information. For example, you could create a tool to count the number of warnings contained in the document or extract and save the warnings in a separate file for further exploration.</p>

                                        <h5 class="pml-chapter-title">Parameters</h5>
                                        <p class="pml-paragraph">Advanced markup languages support <i class="pml-italic">parameters</i> embedded in the markup code. You first define a parameter by assigning a value to a name (e.g. <code class="pml-inline-code">my_email=foo@example.com</code>). Then, later in the document, you use the parameter name, instead of the value. If the value changes later, you just need to change it in one place, which is easy, fast, and less error-prone.</p>
                                        <p class="pml-paragraph">This is an application of the important <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" class="pml-link">Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)</a> principle. It improves maintainability, productivity, and reliability. It is useful for all kinds of recurring text and markup attribute values, especially if they are subject to change. For example: your email address, the price of your product, the name of your dog, or whatever.</p>

                                                <p class="pml-paragraph">Sometimes it is convenient to see a preview of the final document (e.g. a HTML page) <i class="pml-italic">while</i> typing the markup code. As soon as you edit the markup code, you can immediately see the effect, without the need to re-launch the markup processor. Some editors support this kind of immediate feedback out-of-the-box or by plugins. For example, you type the document in one window, and you see the real-time preview in an adjacent window.</p>
                                                <p class="pml-paragraph">You can think of this as a markup editor with WYSIWYG support.</p>

                                                <p class="pml-paragraph">At the bare minimum, an API enables other applications to convert documents. For example, a web server could read markup code stored in a file or entered by the user and convert it to HTML on-the-fly, by using the API. This could be used, for instance, to provide an online markup tester, so that people can try out snippets of markup code, without the need to install anything on their PC.</p>
                                                <p class="pml-paragraph">More advanced APIs can provide additional functionality, such as:</p>
