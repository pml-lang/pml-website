    Should you use a WYSIWYG editor or a markup language?
    
    As so often, the answer depends on your use case.

    However, as demonstrated in this article, in many cases a document markup language is the better choice, because you can benefit from considerable advantages. In a nutshell:
    {list
        {el When you write, you can {i focus on writing}, because you don't have to think about presentation, and you can use your preferred text editor with your customized setup.}
        {el Your writing environment is {i more flexible and powerful}, because you have a lot of options to handle plain text files.}
        {el It is easier to {i automate and customize} your writing process, which saves time and reduces errors.}
    }
    
    Ultimately, a well-designed document markup language makes your writing experience more enjoyable and increases your productivity.
