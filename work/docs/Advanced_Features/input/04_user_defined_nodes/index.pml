[ch (id=user_defined_nodes) [title User-Defined Nodes (Experimental)]

    [note
        User-defined nodes have been temporarily disabled in PMLC version 3.0.0.

        They will be activated again in a future version.
        However, the definition of user-defined nodes will probably be significantly different from the first (experimental) implementation.
