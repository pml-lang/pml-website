[ch (id=warnings) [title Warnings]

    This document is a work in progress.

    Advanced features are first published as an [i experimental] feature. This means that you can try out the feature, but you need to be aware that:
    [list
        [el The feature is not fully developed yet, and may contain bugs. You might encounter limitations and malfunctions.]
        [el The feature is not guaranteed to be backwards-compatible. Anything can change in future versions, although this is avoided as far as possible.]
        [el The documentation might be incomplete and change in future releases.]
    ]

    Experimental features are tagged by the suffix [c() (Experimental)] in their title.

    If you encounter a bug or miss an important functionality, then please submit an [link url=https://github.com/pml-lang/advanced-features-manual/issues text=issue].

    If you have a question or want to discuss anything (e.g. an idea or enhancement), then please create a [link url=https://github.com/pml-lang/advanced-features-manual/discussions text=discussion].
